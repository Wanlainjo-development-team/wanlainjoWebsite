              We work with most health insurance providers. Our billing
              department is happy to process all your insurance paperwork. We
              check your coverage during your first visit and explain your
              benefits during your Report of Findings. If you don’t have
              insurance coverage or have a high co-pay or deductible, ask us
              about our affordable out-of-pocket Wellcare payment plan!

              Did you know that Minnesota drivers and passengers involved in
              motor vehicle accidents are 100% covered for related injuries?
              Workers’ compensation provides similar coverage. Metronet Chiropractic Clinic
              doctors are experts at diagnosing, treating and processing auto
              and work-related injuries. We’ll work with your attorneys, if
              needed, and provide the documentation they need to advocate on
              your behalf.
